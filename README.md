# Discord-Bot-Base
This project was created using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
 
# Read the following before reporting bugs!
### Project dependencies
To install all the dependencies for this project open the folder with VS Code and run `npm i` in the terminal. This will download all the dependencies for your project so you don't have to go looking for them.

### Implementing commands or events
There are examples for an event also for a command inside the project file, for events I recommend using the following event cheat sheets [Cheat Sheet #1](https://github.com/armfxl/discord.js-cheatsheet/blob/main/cheatsheet.js) or [Cheat Sheat #2](https://gist.github.com/koad/316b265a91d933fd1b62dddfcc3ff584).

### Setting up the bot
You need to replace the bot token inside of index.js can be found [here](https://github.com/JerimiahOfficial/Discord-Bot-Base/blob/b09b265e4f32c289ec24dda9f96bd6e22e14be55/source/index.ts#L3). Your bot token can be found on [Developer Portal Link](https://discord.com/developers/applications) don't share this with anyone.

Inside of your VS Code you will see an npm scripts menu, where you can build the bot and start it. The bot can be reloaded by typing "rs" in the terminal thanks to the addition of nodemon.
